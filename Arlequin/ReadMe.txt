I (MPB) did not redo the Arlequin analysis. I did, however track down which file had the corresponding Arlequin output that was reported in the manuscript.
I also verified that the input data matched the results output.
Rather than moving the entire Arlequin folder created by AW to this project folder, I simply moved over only the pertinent input and results files.
